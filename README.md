# AI-Contract-Bot

AI-Contract-Bot is an ongoing project aimed at building and improving a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system tailored specifically for Contract Q&A (question and answer). The goal of this project is to develop a sophisticated AI-powered contract assistant capable of autonomously handling various tasks related to contract drafting, reviewing, and negotiation.

## Business Objective

AI-Contract-Bot is part of the Lizzy AI startup's initiative to develop the next-generation contract AI. By leveraging Hybrid LLM (Large Language Model) technology and advanced RAG techniques, our objective is to create a fully autonomous artificial contract lawyer. The initial focus is on building a powerful contract assistant, with the ultimate goal of developing a fully autonomous contract bot.

## Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Utilizes RAG technology to generate responses by retrieving relevant information from a vast pool of external data sources.
- **Contract Q&A**: Allows users to interact with contracts through natural language queries, enabling tasks such as contract interpretation, clause extraction, and legal advice.

- **Continuous Improvement**: The project emphasizes continuous evaluation and enhancement of the RAG system to ensure accuracy, reliability, and efficiency in contract-related tasks.
